This development_guidelines.md file will be used to keep the AI and I in sync as to the current state of this development work.  Each time we begin a new session, the AI will be instructed to read this file and confirm its understanding of the content. A test has been prepared and will be posted in the chat to quiz the AI on the content of the specification and the current state of the enviroment. We cannot continue development work without confirming that the AI and I are in sync on the current state.
